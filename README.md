## 1. Introduction

Cmusic Coin is designed as a decentralized digital currency focusing on long-term sustainability and community involvement. The project leverages Proof of Work (PoW) for consensus and security, emphasizing a gradual transition from block rewards to transaction fees as the primary incentive for miners.

## 2. Technical Specifications

- **Blockchain Type**: Proof of Work (PoW)
- **Block Time**: 60 seconds
- **Initial Block Reward**: 300 coins
- **Reward Reduction**:
    - 1st reduction at block 200,000 to 200 coins
    - 2nd reduction at block 400,000 to 150 coins
    - 3rd reduction at block 600,000 to 100 coins
    - 4th reduction at block 800,000 to 75 coins
    - 5th reduction at block 1,000,000 to 50 coins
    - Final reduction at block 1,200,000 to 0 coins
- **Donation to Development**: 10% of block rewards

## 3. Block Reward Structure

The block reward starts at 300 coins and reduces at specific block heights over the life of the project, eventually transitioning to a system based primarily on transaction fees.

### Reward Distribution Details

| Period                   | Block Height Range | Reward Per Block (Coins) |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Initial phase            | 0 to 200,000       | 300                      |
| 1st reduction            | 200,001 to 400,000 | 200                      |
| 2nd reduction            | 400,001 to 600,000 | 150                      |
| 3rd reduction            | 600,001 to 800,000 | 100                      |
| 4th reduction            | 800,001 to 1,000,000 | 75                     |
| 5th reduction            | 1,000,001 to 1,200,000 | 50                    |
| Final phase              | 1,200,001 and beyond | 0                      |

### Developer Donation

10% of each block reward is allocated to fund ongoing development and operational expenses, ensuring continuous improvement and sustainability of the network.

## 4. Economic Model

The economic model of Cmusic Coin is designed to ensure the longevity and stability of the network. By gradually reducing the block rewards, the project aims to decrease inflation over time and shift the economic incentive towards transaction fees, which will become the primary reward mechanism for miners after the final reduction.

## 5. Governance

Cmusic Coin is committed to a decentralized governance model, allowing the community to have a significant role in future developments and decisions. Governance decisions will be made through community consensus and mechanisms that will be detailed in later updates.

## 6. Future Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Launch and establishment of the network.
- **Phase 2**: Gradual reduction of block rewards and increase in transaction-based incentives.
- **Phase 3**: Full transition to transaction fee incentives and expanded governance model.

## 7. Conclusion

Cmusic Coin represents a forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency economics, focusing on long-term sustainability and community involvement. By carefully balancing block rewards and transaction fees, Cmusic Coin aims to build a robust network that supports both miners and users as the ecosystem grows.
